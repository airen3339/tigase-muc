== Preparation of database
Before you will be able to use Tigase MUC Component you need to initialize this database. We provide few schemas for this component for MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLServer and DerbyDB.

They are placed in `database/` directory of installation package and named in `dbtype-mucversion.sql`, where `dbname` in name of database type which this schema supports and `version` is version of a MUC component for which this schema is designed.

You need to manually select schema for correct database and component and load this schema to database. For more information about loading database schema look into <<Database Preparation>> section of <<Tigase XMPP Server Administration Guide>>

== Upgrade of database schema
Database schema for our components may change between versions and if so it needs to be updated before new version may be started.
To upgrade schema please follow instuctions from <<Preparation of database>> section.
[NOTE]
If you use SNAPSHOT builds then schema may change for same version as this are versions we are still working on.
